# 👶 How Does Childbirth Affect Women's Lives? — Data Exploration Project

This project explores how childbirth impacts women’s lives globally and specifically within China.  
It uses data exploration techniques to analyze fertility rates, parental leave policies, maternal health, and social factors through a combination of Python (data cleaning) and Tableau (visualization).

## 🔎 Research Questions

1. **How is the childbirth situation across the world?**
2. **What are the potential factors affecting childbirth in China?**

## 📊 Key Topics Analyzed

- Fertility rates and trends globally (1960–2022)
- Maternal death risks over time
- Gender imbalance at birth (sex ratio trends)
- Impact of maternity/paternity leave policies
- China-specific analysis: child policy changes, healthcare access, fertility trends

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python** (Google Colab + Pandas, Openpyxl)
- **Google Sheets** (for feature selection and preliminary checking)
- **Tableau** (for final visualizations)

## 📈 Main Findings

- Fertility rates have sharply declined globally but remain high in parts of Africa and Central Asia.
- Maternal mortality risks improved but some countries worsened during COVID-19.
- Son preference (high male-to-female birth ratios) was detected in China and nearby regions.
- Longer maternity leaves correlated with a **slowing** of fertility decline but were **not sufficient alone**.
- In China, birth policy shifts (one-child, two-child, three-child) were tightly associated with fertility patterns.
